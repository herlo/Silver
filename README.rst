What is Silver?
================
Silver, formerly `PyCamps <http://github.com/herlo/PyCamps/>`_, is inspired by the Perl based `DevCamps project <http://devcamps.org/>`_ created by `EndPoint <http://www.endpoint.com/>`_. The idea is simply to make it easy for developers to have their own environments to build fully functional web applications (with a database) quickly and in a repeatable way.

Please see the `Silver project documentation <https://projects.purpleatom.com/silver/>`_ to get started.
